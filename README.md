# egg_catcher_game
The Egg Catcher Game is a fun arcade game using pygame and random. The player moves a basket left/right to catch falling eggs. Each caught egg increases the score, while missed ones reduce lives. Eggs spawn at random positions with increasing speed. The game ends when all lives are lost. Itâ€™s a great beginner project for learning game development .
